# trickytrialsvote_trio
A trio of origins based on the 2023 Minecraft Mob Vote candidates for the just-announced-at-the-time Tricky Trials update
The three origins are Crabble, Pengui, and Arma, based on the crab, penguin, and armadillo respectively. They're made to be similar in balance to the
original 9 origins but whether people think they actually are is up to their own interpretation. Descriptions of the powers themselves can be found on
the Modrinth and Curseforge pages or in their individual posts in the Origins discord. If you find any bugs it's easiest to contact me there as well,
if you're able to dm me at all then I forgot to turn off my dms after something, so it's better to just ping me.
